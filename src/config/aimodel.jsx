DAY 1 (ARRIVAL DAY) RULES:
âœ… ADJUST Day 1 activities based on arrival time:

   - Hotel check-in: 15-30 minutes
   - Freshen up and rest: 30-60 minutes
   - Standard check-in time: 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM
   - EXAMPLE: "2:00 PM - Hotel Check-in at [Hotel Name]" with details "Check-in, freshen up, and settle into your accommodation"
âœ… START first sightseeing activity NO EARLIER than 2-3 hours after assumed arrival time
âœ… Day 1 should be LIGHTER schedule (2-3 activities max AFTER check-in)
âœ… Focus on nearby attractions to hotel, minimal travel
âœ… Include welcome activities: light lunch, city orientation, nearby sights
âœ… MANDATORY Day 1 structure: Hotel Check-in â†’ Rest â†’ Light Activities â†’ Return to Hotel

LAST DAY (DEPARTURE DAY) RULES:
âœ… ASSUME traveler departs in afternoon/evening (unless specified otherwise)
âœ… MANDATORY hotel check-out activity:
   - Standard check-out time: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM (noon)
   - Packing and preparation: 30-60 minutes before check-out
   - MUST include explicit check-out activity in itinerary
   - EXAMPLE: "11:00 AM - Hotel Check-out" with details "Pack belongings, settle bills, check-out from [Hotel Name]"
âœ… MUST factor in post-checkout logistics:
   - Hotel to airport/terminal transfer: 30-90 minutes
   - Airport early arrival: 2 hours before DOMESTIC flights, 3-4 hours international
âœ… Activities BEFORE check-out must END by 10:30 AM latest

   - Lunch: 12:00-1:30 PM (mandatory, budget â‚±200-500 per person)
   - Dinner: 6:30-8:00 PM (mandatory, budget â‚±300-800 per person)
âœ… If hotel includes breakfast, still list as activity: "7:30 AM - Breakfast at hotel restaurant"
âœ… Include rest periods: 30-60 min breaks between major activities
âœ… Don't exceed 8-10 hours of active time per day
âœ… EVERY DAY MUST END with "Return to hotel" activity:
   - Schedule between 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM
   - Include travel time from last activity location
   - Example: "8:00 PM - Return to hotel and rest"
   - This should be the LAST activity entry for each day

TRANSPORTATION CONSIDERATIONS:
âœ… Mention transportation method in placeDetails when relevant:
   - "15-min taxi ride from hotel"
   - "Accessible by jeepney, 30 minutes"
   - "Near hotel, walking distance"
âœ… Group nearby attractions together on same day
